# OpenPUFF
Some R scripts to run CALPUFF, still under development.
## Working:
### GLC2CALPUFF.R:
Generating elevation data for CALPUFF Terrel based on DEM data, should be working with WGS84 projected DEM data.
Generating landuse data for CALPUFF CTGPROC based on FROM-GLC 30m landuse data, data downloading codes were provided along the code.
### CALPUFFEM.R:
Genterating emission inventory for CALPUFF, now point sources were suggested.
### PlotCALPUFF.R:
Plotting CALPUFF Winds and Concentrations using ggplot2 and metR, slow for complicated simulations.
